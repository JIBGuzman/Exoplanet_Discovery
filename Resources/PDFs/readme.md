# PDFs Folder Overview

## Location
`Resources/PDFs` (subfolder within the main Resources directory)

## Purpose
The `PDFs` folder contains curated academic papers, theses, and foundational resources relevant to exoplanet transit detection, photometry, machine learning for exoplanet science, and key exoplanet databases. All files in this folder are in **PDF format** and are selected for their value in offline reference, in-depth research, and project documentation.

## How to Use These Resources

- **Offline Access:** All files are downloadable for local review, annotation, or citation.
- **Reference:** Use these PDFs for foundational understanding, literature reviews, algorithm benchmarking, and citation in your workflow or project documentation.
- **Collaboration:** Tag newly added PDFs as "Algorithm", "Simulation", or "Data Exploration" for easier navigation. Suggest additional readings with a pull request or comment in this folder.

## Folder Maintenance

- Please ensure all added files are in PDF format and clearly titled.
- Add a brief description for new uploads in this markdown file when updating.
- For major updates or new milestone papers, pin a list in your projectâ€™s Space thread.
